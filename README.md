# DynamicDescriptionNotes

ProcessWire module for using PW variables and Hanna codes in Description and Note fields.

Specifiy fields/properties of the page, eg:
[page.parent.url]
[page.title]
[page.template.label]

You can also define a str_replace to be performed on the returned value, eg: [page.name.(-|_)]
which will return the page name with the dashes replaced with underscores

An option to allow raw HTML is available

You can also use hanna codes within your description and notes fields - big thanks to @Robin S for this idea
